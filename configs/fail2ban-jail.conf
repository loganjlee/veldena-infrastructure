# Fail2Ban SSH Jail Configuration
# Bans IPs after 3 failed SSH attempts for 24 hours
#
# Why these values:
# - maxretry=3: matches sshd MaxAuthTries so lockout is consistent
# - findtime=600: 10-minute window to accumulate failures
# - bantime=86400: 24-hour ban discourages repeat attempts
# - action=iptables-multiport: blocks at firewall level, not application level
